A websocket io game hosted on https://reelerio.herokuapp.com/ - might take a few moments to load. (Will eventually be accessible through https://reeler.io)

Play as a fisherman and pull your friends (or enemies) into the black holes!

Works best with multiple players/connections (if you don't have anyone to play with right now, you can join the game in two different tabs and play against yourself, although the physics are much more interesting with 2+!)
